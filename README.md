# Deep-Learning-with-Piano
This is a project to explore possibilities of application of Deep Learning in piano music. 

My final goal is generating piano music with style, composer parameters.

(e.g. "Waltz" & "Chopin" -> Generate a waltz-style music which sounds like a Chopin's work).

I am thinking to utilize DSP, neural style transfer, and GAN to achieve the goal.

In this repo, I will keep updating my progress.

# Abstract Idea

First, I will start with Chopin's music only (my favorite composer).
1. Import as many music as possible.
2. Label each music's style, feelings, and other parameters.
3. Cut each music into pieces and shuffle to increase training data size.
4. Train GAN. 
5. (to be continued)...
